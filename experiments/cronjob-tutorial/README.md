# CronJob Tutorial Operators

This directory contains two implementations of the ["Building a CronJob Controller" tutorial from the Kubebuilder book](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/cronjob-tutorial.html):

- `kubebuilder/`: Written in Go using Kubebuilder.
- `kube-rs/`: A naive port to Rust using the Kube.rs framework.

These were used for learning and framework comparison purposes.
