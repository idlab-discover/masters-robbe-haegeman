# Meeting Notes

Each of the notes consists of a preparation and a meeting section.

The preparation section is what the name implies: the notes I create before the meeting to remember what I want to talk about.
These are not exhaustive: they do not contain everything that was done before the meeting and also do not contain every question I end up asking.

> [!NOTE]
> These are not the "raw notes" I create during the meetings.  
> Those are often in Dutch, are not structured very clearly and are not filtered.
