# Overview of used sources within the project

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a list of sources used within the thesis itself, instead it is a collection of all sources used to gain an understanding of the problem and how to solve it.
> A lot of these sources will come back, but a source highlighting how to debug operators is not very imporant for the written assignment, but can still be marked as important due to helping during investigations.
> The Githubs of operators used in testing for example, will also not be included
